### Setting up projects with xcconfigs

Presented on [Mobile Warsaw #68](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Warsaw/events/259119040) on February 26, 2019.

I will talk about one of the most underrated Xcode features — the ability to define build settings in separate, external files. I will start by showing the problems with defining build settings in the UI and then I'll move on to xcconfigs, focusing on its syntax and unique features.

### Generating tests with SwiftCheck

Presented on [Swift.map #3](https://www.facebook.com/events/570088463329510) on December 12, 2017.

I will share how to take advantage of property-based testing using SwiftCheck and use it to catch bugs before even encountering them during manual testing. I will start by discussing what's most important about writing tests and then I'll present how you can use SwiftCheck to make your computer generate tests for you.

### Wrapping C libraries in Swift

Presented on [Mobile Warsaw #42](http://mobile-warsaw.pl/meetup_042.html) on October 17, 2016.

One of Swift’s greatest strengths is its seamless interoperability with C and Objective-C. During this talk, I will discuss a practical approach to wrapping existing C libraries in Swift and designing a natural API on top of them.
