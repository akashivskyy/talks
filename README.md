# Adrian Kashivskyy's Talks

### [Don't write tests... Generate them!](swiftcheck)

Presented at [let Swift #5](https://www.facebook.com/events/1769082693354650/) on November 17, 2016.

If you ever wondered whether it is possible for your project to test itself, search no more! During this talk, we'll go over the basics of Property-Based Testing and composing unit tests using generators which look for edge cases by themselves. Inspired by [Brian Gesiak's talk at Functional Swift Conference 2014](http://2014.funswiftconf.com/speakers/brian.html).
